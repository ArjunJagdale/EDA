This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic. The goal is to explore the dataset, uncover trends and insights, and visualize relationships between different features. These insights can later be used for predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset includes the following columns:
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1, 2, 3)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger (male/female)
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard
- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- **Survived**: Whether the passenger survived (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

## Project Objectives

- Clean the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates, etc.).
- Visualize relationships between features.
- Analyze the distribution of key features like **Age**, **Fare**, and **Survived**.
- Investigate survival rates across different passenger categories (e.g., **Pclass**, **Sex**, **Age**).
- Perform basic feature engineering (e.g., creating new features such as family size).
- Prepare the data for potential machine learning models.
